## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions for labs and programming assignments on Coursera courses. Certain resources required by the codes may be lacking due to limitations on downloading course materials from Coursera and uploading them to GitHub. The lacking resources are mostly datasets, pre-trained models or certain weight matrices.

This new deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems. To develop a deeper understanding of how neural networks work, we recommend that you take the Deep Learning Specialization.

## Courses
1. [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://github.com/chandlerbing65nm/Tensorflow-Developer-Coursera/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow%20for%20Artificial%20Intelligence%2C%20Machine%20Learning%2C%20and%20Deep%20Learning)

      If you are a software developer who wants to build scalable AI-powered algorithms, you need to understand how to use the tools to build them. This course is part of the 
      upcoming Machine Learning in Tensorflow Specialization and will teach you best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning. 
      
2. [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://github.com/chandlerbing65nm/Tensorflow-Developer-Coursera/tree/main/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks%20in%20TensorFlow)

      In Course 2 of the deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization, you will learn advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model you built in Course 1. You will 
      explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” 
      information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout. Finally, Course 2 will introduce you to transfer 
      learning and how learned features can be extracted from models. 

3. [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://github.com/chandlerbing65nm/Tensorflow-Developer-Coursera/tree/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Tensorflow)

      In Course 3 of the deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization, you will build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow. You will learn to process text, 
      including tokenizing and representing sentences as vectors, so that they can be input to a neural network. You’ll also learn to apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in TensorFlow. 
      Finally, you’ll get to train an  LSTM on existing text to create original poetry!
      
4. [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://github.com/chandlerbing65nm/Tensorflow-Developer-Coursera/tree/main/Sequences%2C%20Time%20Series%20and%20Prediction)

      In this fourth course, you will learn how to build time series models in TensorFlow. You’ll first implement best practices to prepare time series data. You’ll also explore 
      how RNNs and 1D ConvNets can be used for prediction. Finally, you’ll apply everything you’ve learned throughout the Specialization to build a sunspot prediction model 
      using real-world data!
